LibSubspace is a C++ library for pattern recognition in subspaces. The library implements classes and functions for reading and writing samples, learning subspaces based on the training data and preforming classification tests. Currently, subspace generation based on principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is implemented. Given a set of image samples, the library also supports the learning and testing of local subspaces, for example Local Binary LDA (LBLDA) subspace, as was described in the paper:
